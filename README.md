# Cart-Pole-game-with-Reinforcement-Learning
Learning Cart Pole game using Reinforcement Learning in Pytorch

Solved a classic inverted pendulum problem of control theory in OpenAI gym using REINFORCE, Deep-Q Learning and Double Deep-Q Learning. Finely tuned hyperparameters such as max epsilon, min epsilon, epsilon decay, batch size, replay capacity, learning rate, gamma discount factor, hidden node number, average steps per episode, reward amount given to agent when game continues running, reward amount given to agent when game fails, time interval of target network updates, epochs (episode interval of output printing), etc. This fine tuning helped achieve average training length of 200-220 iterations.
